# **Toy Robot Code Challenge**

A sample code challenge to evaluate coding abilities and approach to solving problems.

This toy robot is coded in C# and .NET 6.

The thinking here is provide a simple but comprehensive solution that demonstrates the following features:

- Robustness
	 A comprehensive set of unit tests validates the execution and acuracy of the allowed commands.
- Scalability
	 The application caters for a grid of any size. This is controlled by 2 constants on the ToyRobotConstants but can also be made an environment variable.
- Low memory usage
	Only the status of the robot needs to be known at any given point. Therefore static classes and methods are used extensively
- Readability
	The coding constructs and practises are kept simple to make debugging simple and easier to follow
- Graphical Visual Aid
	A graphical visual aid has been added to make debugging easier.
